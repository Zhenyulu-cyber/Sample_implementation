# Sample_implementation

1. The SAT solver STP can refer to : http://stp.github.io/ 

2. There are two STP input files of the form '.CVC'.
   1. File 'GEC_RECTANGLE_K11_GEC55_Ori.cvc' is the original model without bit-slicing technique under 2 inputs gate, such as XOR, XNOR, OR, NOR, AND, NAND,
   2. File 'GEC_RECTANGLE_K11_GEC55_BS2.cvc' is the model using bit-slicing under 2 inputs gate.

3. The file 'GEC_BS4.cpp' is the code of Algorithm 1 in section 3.2.
